# Application of Bootstrap-Sampling in Random Forest 

1) Generating 30 samples for Bootstrap Sampling in 3:2 ratio.
2)  Modelling on all 30 samples and finding MSE with respect to each model. 
3)  Finding mean of 30 samples. 


### Here we dont have the standard deviation of mean_squared_error  population so we are going to use
### second method in which we find the standard deviation of our sample.
